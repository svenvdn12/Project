"base css and simple file structure added"
15-09-2025

added the base css with "main.css" for Project Chaos, along side a simple file structure currently supporting fonts, images and different icons.
This is only the base of css and tried to make is as general as possible, and using variables found at the top of "main.css" to make most values easy to edit site-wide.
This also means some page specific css is not here yet.

Please place files in the proper locations wwithin the file structure to keep things clean.
When unsupported file types are added, please create a new folder in the root of "assets", or in an appropriate subfolder.
